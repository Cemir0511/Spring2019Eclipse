	It belongs to the class
	It is shared by the class
	Its also known as shared variable

	 We call it Shared variable or class variable.
	 
	               
	               Instance VArible  VS Static Variable
	               
	 **  Instance variable are object variables and each object object created from the class will have its own 
	 *copy if it.It will not be shared by all objects
	 *
	 *     Static variable are class variables, can be accessed using classname (if it is not private)
	 *     and single central copy of variable that is shared accross all objects.

/*             Static Method VS Non=static Instance Method:
 
 Static Methods     can be called by using the CLASSNAME>
 Static method can also be called using an Object
 
 
 Instance Methods can Only be used by creating an object from the class.
 
 
 
 Static methods cannot use non=static variables or methods.
 
 
 
 ///////////   Summary
  * 
  Static members/class members:
  
        they are attached /tied/belong to the class itself. and not dendent on object creation.
        Can be accessed using classname.
        
        Static variables are shared by all object and there is only one copy.
        
        static variable if they are not private, can be accessed using classname.
        
        static methods can be called using ClassName and without creating an object..
        Objects can also call static methods.
        
        Normally we use static method for utility methods that do not depend on individual object data
        
        static methods cannot invoke non-static variables or methods.
